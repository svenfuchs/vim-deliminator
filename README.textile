h1. Vim Deliminator

Balancing of delimiters in Vim, targetted at writing Ruby.

* Autocloses parenthesis, brackets, braces, quotes and backticks,
* balances whitespace within parenthesis and
* makes backspacing a delimiter delete its pair as well.

See the "Vim doc":http://github.com/svenfuchs/vim-deliminator/blob/master/doc/deliminator.txt for details.
